# HazardExecutor
Hazard is the best level 7 executor, which includes unrestricted Lua and included beaming tools. Hazard is made in C++ and Py. It is speedy and undetectable. Our servers are always online (9+ servers) so you never lose your scripts! All of your scripts are backed up to the cloud, so you will never lose them unless Hazard goes offline.





!!!Important!!!
If the Executor doesn't start, disable your anti-virus. It is hindering the Executor from booting up.
